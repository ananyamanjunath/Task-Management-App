## Description

The Task Management Application is a simple yet effective tool designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. Built as an assignment for the first round of the full-stack developer job role at PedalStart, this application offers features for adding, updating, and deleting tasks, streamlining task management and enhancing productivity. Whether you're an individual user or part of a team, this application provides a user-friendly interface for seamless task tracking.

## Features

-   Mobile-friendly design for easy access and usability on various devices.

-   Update tasks with new information.
-   Delete tasks when they're completed or no longer relevant.

## Warning Note

Please note that while the Task Management Application offers convenient task management capabilities, it's essential to maintain backup copies of critical tasks and information. Unexpected errors or data loss may occur, so it's advisable to regularly export or back up your task lists to ensure no important information is lost.
